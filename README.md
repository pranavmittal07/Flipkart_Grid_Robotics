This project aims to develop the smart vision quality checking system using the Artificial Intelligence. I use the Qwen2-VL-2B model for text recognition &amp; decision making from the images.

# Use the google collaboratory for running of the project as it requires good GPU and the disk storage.

step 1) Load the Model

step 2) Create a excel worksheet

step 3) Upload images

step 4) run the model for those images

step 5) process the output using regular expression

step 6) add the processed output in product_analysis.csv

## We can also Fine Tune it using the LLaMA-Factory.
